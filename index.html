                <h1>1.Bugatti Chiron</h1>
                <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AP2hEzsOwHs/maxresdefault.jpg " width="500" height="300">
                <p>Enter in 2016 the Chiron. Where the Veyron used aluminium spaceframe construction, the Chiron has a lighter carbonfibre monocoque. Where the Veyron stopped short of 1200bhp in its final forms, the Chiron ups that to nearly 1500bhp. And where the Veyron left Bugatti's top speed yardstick at 268mph, the Chiron has, in 1578bhp Super Sport form, taken what has become an increasingly highly contested world production car speed record up beyond the 300mph marker, where it currently rests at 304.7mph. And if you want a hypercar to make record speeds so easy to achieve, this is the one for you. Bugatti's more fiercely blown 16-cylinder engine certainly has a bit of turbo lag to haul through and isn't the sweetest-sounding of leviathan lumps – more departing hovercraft or express train than car. But when it starts to surge, it knows absolutely no moderation.</p>

                <h1>2.Aston Martin Valkyrie</h1>
                 <img src="https://www.topgear.com/sites/default/files/2023/03/1-Aston-Martin-Valkyrie.jpg" " width="500" height="300">
                 <p>The Aston Martin is really a purebred racer that you just so happen to be able to put in for an MoT. The lightweight carbon tub has been designed with strength in mind, while the knee-high body’s surfaces have been sculpted by wind tunnel data and feature adaptive aero surfaces. The suspension is equally trick, its active adjustable ride height aiming to keep the car on an even keel as aero and cornering forces build. Yet arguably the highlight is the naturally aspirated (but very mild hybrid assisted) 6.5-litre V12 motor that revs to a heady 11,000rpm and delivers a knockout 1140bhp punch for 0-62mph in 2.5 seconds and a 220mph top speed.</p>                 

                 <h1>3.Pininfarina Battista</h1>
                 <img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/pininfarina-battista-104-1657644450.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*" " width="500" height="300">  
                 <p>With a 1876bhp on tap, true hypercar pace was never going to be a problem for the Pininfarina Battista, even when you consider that this carbonfibre-hulled machine tips the scales at a not inconsiderable 2200kg. Essentially a reskinned Rimac Nevera, the Battista is one of the first of an all-new generation of high-performance electric cars that have their eyes firmly focused on a future where the internal combustion engine is put out to pasture. The car's raw statistics certainly make for startling reading, with a 0-62mph taking less than 2sec and 186mph coming up after only 12sec – the sort of acceleration that had our very own Matt Prior giggling like a schoolboy when he sampled it. Yet the Battista blends this extraordinarily explosive turn of speed with genuine driver engagement. Up to 1206bhp is developed by the two rear motors (there are another pair for the front wheels), which means that on track it's extremely throttle-adjustable, allowing you to exit corners at all angles of atta                  ck. The steering is also slick and positive, while on the road it just about lives up to the Pininfarina brand's claimed GT credentials, with effortless performance, a claimed 311-mile range and adaptive dampers that serves up a controlled ride. It is a bit noisy mind, with the carbonfibre structure transmitting to many clonks and thuds from the suspension.</p>

                  <h1>4.Lotus Evija</h1>
                  <img src="https://images.hgmsites.net/hug/lotus-evija-fittipaldi_100859430_h.jpg" width="500" height="300">  
                   <p>If you were in any doubt about which way the high performance wind was blowing, then the appearance of two EVs in our hypercar top 10 should leave you in no doubt. We love high-revving, noisy, fast and dramatic combustion-engined machines, but the appeal of instant, walloping, vectored-per-corner torque isn’t hard to deny - and the Lotus Evija serves that up in spades. So far our man Mike Duff has only driven the Norfolk’s firm’s fast flagship in prototype form around Lotus's own test track at Hethel, but the initial impressions are promising. Electric or not, this car's key vital statistics leave nothing to chance. Its 70kWh drive battery and quartet of electric motors make it weigh some 1700kg; but it also develops some 2000 metric horsepower at peak, runs on Pirelli P-Zero Trofeo R tyres and is claimed to be capable of 0-186mph in just 9sec (more than 4sec quicker than Bugatti's sensational Chiron can do it).</p>

                   <h1>5.McLaren Senna</h1>
                    <img src="https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/McLaren-Senna-1a-1024x555.jpg" width="500" height="300">  
                    <p>The Senna is a car of truly astonishing track abilities. Even though its not the most powerful car to have lapped our dry handling circuit, it has such phenomenal reserves of grip that it smashed our dry-handling track lap record by fully a second-and-a-half when we road-tested it in 2018. Developing some 800kg of downforce at its peak, and with a growling V8 of just under 800bhp, it's a car you expect to be a nerve-testing challenge on track and almost impossible to drive on the road. The simple fact is that neither is true. The Senna looks after you – and keeps looking after you with its feedback, stability and drivability as you hit the kinds of speeds only usually known to prototype racing machines. It's a physical test to drive, but a supreme, unforgettable mental treat. And although it's less broad-batted and usable than most hypercars of its price, its dedication of the business of going quickly round in two-and-a-half-mile circles is utterly spellbinding.</p>
